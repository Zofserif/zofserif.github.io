## Matrix Operation!

Now that you've learned about matrices, let's do something about it! Up for the task? Let's go Comrade!


****

## Transposition


Example of a transposition

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/transposition.png)

##### The transposition of a matrix is labeled by T. To represent that the matrix became a transposition matrix.

Let's do it in CODE!

```javascript
A = np.array([
    [1 ,2, 5],
    [5, -1, 0],
    [0, -3, 3]
])
np.transpose(A)

```
To transpose a matrix in code using np.transpose() function.

****

## Dot Product!

Dot product is going to get the sum of products of vectors by row-column pairs as seen below.

Now that you have a grasp of Dot product. Here's how you do it in code

```javascript

A @ B

np.dot(A,B)

A.dot(B)

np.matmul(A,B)

```

As you can see there are many ways to get the Dot product of matrices in code! You have the option. Enjoy!

## Determinant

Remember how to compute for the determinant of a matrix. It is useful in Differential Equations!

Doing it in code:

```javascript
A = np.array([
    [1,4],
    [0,3]
])
np.linalg.det(A)


```
To find the determinant of a matrix in code using np.linalg.det() function.


****

## Inverse 


Example of a Inverse Matrix

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/inverse.png)

##### To get the inverse matrix, it needs to multiply it with the inverse of the determinant

Let's do it in CODE!

```javascript
M = np.array([
    [1,7],
    [-3, 5]
])

np.linalg.inv(M)

```
To inverse a matrix in code using np.linalg.inv() function.

****

Now time for some Activity!!

### Prove in code the following equations!

1. A @ B != B @ A
2. A @ (B @ C) == (A @ B) @ C
3. A @ np.add(B,C) == np.add((A @ B),(A @ C))
4. (np.add(B,C)) @ A == np.add((B @ A),(C @ A))
5. A  @ np.identity(4) == A
6. A @ np.zeros(shape = A.shape) == np.zeros(shape = A.shape)

Create a matrix and compare the results.
