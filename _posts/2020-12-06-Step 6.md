## Describing the matrix

```javascript
def describe_mat(matrix):
    print(f'Matrix:\n{matrix}\n\nShape:\t{matrix.shape}\nRank:\t{matrix.ndim}\n')
```

This is a function that can describe the shape and rank of the matrix

### Matrix example:

```javascript
A = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [3, 1]
])
describe_mat(A)
```

### Output:

Matrix:

[[1 2]


 [3 1]]

Shape:	(2, 2)
Rank:	2


The shape of the matrix is (2,2) the first number represent how many rows in the matrix and the second number represent how many columns in the matrix.
