****

## Vector Operations

### Initializing data

```javascript
A = np.array([1,2,0])
B = np.array([3,1,-2])
```

****
## Vector Addition

Element-wise addition of the scalar values of the vectors.

```javascript
A+B
```

### Output:

### array([ 4,  3, -2])

****

## Vector Subtraction

It is similar to vector addition but changing the second vector into negative numbers.

```javascript
A-B
```

### Output:

### array([-2,  1,  2])

****

## Vector Multiplication

Multiplying the elements or the scalars of the vectors individually.


```javascript
A*B
```

### Output:

### array([3, 2, 0])

****

## Vector Division

Dividing the vectors elemen-wise.

```javascript
A/B
```

### Output:

### array([ 0.33333333, 2, -0])

****

## Modulus of a Vector

formula for the modulus

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/modulus.png)

### For example

```javascript
np.linalg.norm(A)
```
Using the NumPy library

### Output:

### 2.23606797749979

****

## Vector Dot Product

Inner product of a vector is the sum of the products of each elements of the vectors.

### Example 

```javascript
np.inner(H,G)
```

Using the inner() function of in NumPy library computes for the vector dot product


## So! You finished reading the Vector Operations? Here are your activities in this step.

1. Not using the NumPy's functions. Make a function that computes for the modulus of a vector.
2. Not using the NumPy's functions. Make a function that computes vector dot product.
