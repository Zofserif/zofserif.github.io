## System of Linear Equations

You're so fast! Slow down and let's learn about system of Linear Equation.

****

#### Experience is the beset Teacher!

Let's try some scenario and do it in code!

### SCENARIO:

At a store you purchase 2 bottle water & 3 candy bars for 5.25 dollars. Your friend purchase 5 bottle waters & 1 candy bar for 8.25 dollars. What is the cost of a bottle water and a candy bar?

### CREATE A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATION:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/systemlinear.png)

### NOW LET'S TRY IT IN CODE:

```python

foods = np.array([
    [2, 3],
    [5, 1]
])
cost_all = np.array([
    [5.25],
    [8.25]
])

prices = np.linalg.inv(foods) @ cost_all
print('The price of one bottle water is: $ {:.2f}'.format(float(prices[0])))
print('The price of one candy bar is: $ {:.2f}'.format(float(prices[1])))

```
### OUTPUT:

	The price of one bottle water is: $ 1.50
	The price of one candy bar is: $ 0.75
